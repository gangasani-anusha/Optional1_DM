Below are the data mining algorithms that are implemented in this paper:

**Apriori algorithm** refers to a mining frequent products sets and relevant association rules. Generally, the apriori algorithm operates on a database containing a huge number of transactions.

**Gradient Boosting Machine or GBM** combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to generate the final predictions. Keep in mind that all the weak learners in a gradient boosting machine are decision trees.

**FP-growth** is an improved version of the Apriori Algorithm which is widely used for frequent pattern mining(AKA Association Rule Mining). It is used as an analytical process that finds frequent patterns or associations from data sets.

**Kmeans algorithm** is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into ' n ' pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different as possible.

**Decision Trees** are used for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the recordâ€™s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.

**Random Forest algorithm** establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome.

**AdaBoost algorithm** is a Boosting technique used as an Ensemble Method in Machine Learning. It is called Adaptive Boosting as the weights are re-assigned to each instance, with higher weights assigned to incorrectly classified instances.
